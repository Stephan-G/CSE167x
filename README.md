CSE167x Computer Graphics Xcode7 template projects

This repository contains the template projects for the homework assignments of CS167x Computer graphics by the University of San Diego offered on edx.org

Please note that in order to run the homeworks from within Xcode, you have to use an active working directory. To do this, click on the active scheme (top bar in Xcode), then click 'Edit Scheme...'. In the 'Options' tab, make sure to check 'Use custom working directory' and set it to the actual project directory (usually 'HWx' whereever you cloned the repository to, where x is the number of the homework assignment).
